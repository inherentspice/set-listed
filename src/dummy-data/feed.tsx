    post: `Hey everyone! I'm excited to announce that I've just moved to London and I'm ready to hit the comedy scene! As a young Chinese comedian, I'm bringing a fresh perspective and a unique voice to the stage.
    I've always loved making people laugh and I can't wait to share my material with new audiences here in London. I've been performing stand-up for a few years now and have honed my craft through countless open mic nights and comedy clubs.
    If you're in London and looking for a good laugh, be sure to check out my upcoming shows. I'll be performing at various comedy clubs and events throughout the city. You can also follow me on social media to stay up-to-date on my latest shows and material.
    Thanks for reading and I hope to see you at a show soon!`,
